In the notebook "DCM_EPR_Numpyro_Demo.ipynb", we present Bayesian inference applied to a dynamical causal model of ERP/EEG/MEG data. 
We use NUTS in Numpyro, with the chains initialized at the tail of the Gamma prior distribution.

In "DCM_EPR_Numpyro_MultimodalityRemedy.ipynb", we go deeper into the analysis. By following this process, you can skip the demo.
Initially, we run the chains with default values. Then, we address the omnipresent multimodality in this model, dur high dimensionality and correlated parameters, by using weighted stacking as a remedy. Finally, we rerun the chains with initialization at the tail of the Gamma prior distribution for the sake of completeness.
